# TL;TR

This is a capstone project for the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. The goal of this project was to create a CNN model from scratch to classify dog breeds. This project was conducted and approved by a Udacity reviewer.

# Project Overview

The end goal of this project was to create a classification model that predicts a dog breed from a given image. If the image only shows a human, then the algorithm will detect the human and return the dog breed for the human face. See the [proposal](https://github.com/mstolin/ML-Engineer-Capstone/blob/master/proposal/proposal.pdf) for more information.
